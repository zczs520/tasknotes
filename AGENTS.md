# TASKquence - Agent Development Guide

This is an Obsidian plugin. The plugin ID is `taskquence`.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Build the plugin and copy files to the vault's plugin directory
npm run build:test

# After building, reload the plugin in the running Obsidian instance
obsidian vault=test plugin:reload id=taskquence
```

Always run both commands after making changes. Obsidian must be running for the CLI to work.

## Useful Obsidian CLI Commands

```bash
# Check for JavaScript errors after reload
obsidian vault=test dev:errors

# View console output
obsidian vault=test dev:console

# Run JavaScript in the Obsidian context
obsidian vault=test eval code="app.vault.getFiles().length"

# Take a screenshot to verify UI changes
obsidian vault=test dev:screenshot path=screenshot.png

# Open developer tools
obsidian vault=test devtools
```

## Other Build Commands

```bash
npm test              # Run unit tests (Jest)
npm run lint          # Lint source files
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript type checking only
npm run build         # Production build (without copying to vault)
```

Ensure all code changes pass linting checks. Do not weaken linting rules in order to get changes to pass. 

---

When you make changes, update docs/releases/unreleased.md. If your changes are related to a GitHub issue or PR, include acknowledgement of the individual who opened the issue or submitted the PR. Do not update unreleased.md for the addition of tests; unreleased.md is user-facing. 

You may update `.ops/` files locally as you work on items, but do not commit `.ops/` files. `.ops/` is local-only working state.

## Investigating issues

When investigating issues, you should try your best to reproduce them first. You can do a lot with the obsidian cli tool. If you have a theory about what is causing an issue, test that theory.

Not all reported issues will require changes to the code, and not all feature requests need to be implemented; Bases are very powerful, but can be difficult to navigate. If something is not working, or is being asked for, figure out if it is--or can be--achieved through Bases first.

## Prepare for a release. 

When asked to prepare for a release: 

1. Run through the @I18N_GUIDE.md and make sure translations are up-to-date (and in their target language--not English placeholders). 
2. Make sure ALL `npm run test` tests are passing. 
3. Make sure there are no linting errors.
4. Make sure all items in @docs/releases/unreleased.md thank the correct issue/pr opener (double check), as well as those who have commented on the issue/pr. Make sure the copy is appropriate--it is user facing so it should not be overly technical. Make sure it is free from anything that resembles marketing copy. do not thank callumalpass 
5. Update `.ops` draft comments and matching Pickle requests for issues addressed in release notes but not yet closed. Start from the release notes, inspect each issue/comment thread individually, make sure `draft_issue_comment` and `draft_close_reason` are appropriate, create/update/cancel closeout Pickle requests as needed, and validate both `.ops` and `.ops/_pickle`. Do not commit `.ops/` files.
6. Move the body of unreleased.md to <VERSION NUMBER>.md, following the pattern of previous releases. Leave the comments that explain unreleased.md inside unreleased.md.
7. Update @manifest.json and @package.json.
8. Commit changes as "release <VERSION NUMBER>" (you can choose the version number unless it is specified).
9. Tag the commit. (Just version number, no 'v' prefix.)
