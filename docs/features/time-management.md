# Time Management

TaskNotes includes features for time tracking and productivity, such as a time tracker and a Pomodoro timer.

## Time Tracking

TaskNotes has a time tracker to record the time spent on each task. Time tracking information is stored in the `timeEntries` array within each task's YAML frontmatter. Each time entry includes a start time and an end time.

The time tracking interface includes controls to start and stop tracking in task views and task cards. TaskNotes prevents duplicate active sessions on the same task. Active sessions on different tasks can exist at the same time, and total time spent on each task is calculated from completed sessions.

### Auto-Stop Time Tracking

TaskNotes can automatically stop time tracking when a task is marked as completed. This feature ensures that time tracking data accurately reflects work completion without requiring manual timer management.

The auto-stop feature works by monitoring task status changes across all views and interfaces. When a task's status changes from any non-completed state to a completed state (as defined by the custom status configuration), any active time tracking session for that task is automatically terminated.

**Configuration Options:** Configure these under `Settings -> TaskNotes -> Features` (Time Tracking section).

- **Auto-stop tracking** - Enable or disable the automatic stopping behavior (enabled by default)
- **Completion notification** - Show a notice when auto-stop occurs (disabled by default)

**Behavior:**

- Monitors all task status changes in real-time
- Stops only the specific task that was completed (other active timers continue)
- Preserves the recorded time data in the task's time entries
- Works with both standard and recurring task completions
- Functions across all task views (list, kanban, calendar, etc.)

The feature integrates with the custom status system, so completion detection respects your configured workflow statuses rather than relying on hardcoded completion states.

## Time Statistics

The generated `TaskNotes/Views/time-statistics.base` dashboard summarizes ordinary task
time tracking without requiring Pomodoro sessions. Open it from the **Time statistics**
ribbon icon or the **Open time statistics** command.

- The summary row shows total tracked time, involved tasks, time-entry count, and average
  time per active day for the selected period.
- **Day** uses a compact time-of-day timeline, **week** and **year** use stacked trend
  bars, and **month** uses a daily activity heatmap.
- Task rankings, tag distribution, and recent time entries stay visible together so you
  can compare where the time went without switching views. A task with multiple tags
  contributes its full duration to every tag; distribution percentages use the total
  attributed tag time so the visual remains comparable.
- Day, week, month, and year controls open on the current period and can navigate backward
  through history. Selecting a task or time entry opens its task note.

The dashboard reads the tasks currently returned by its Base query. Completed and archived
tasks remain in the statistics while their files exist. Deleting a task removes its time
from the dashboard. Sessions crossing midnight are split across the affected calendar
days, and active sessions update while they run.

## Pomodoro Timer

TaskNotes also includes a Pomodoro timer, which is a tool for time management that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, separated by short breaks. The Pomodoro timer in TaskNotes has a dedicated view with controls to start, stop, and reset the timer.

When a task is associated with a Pomodoro session, the time is automatically recorded in the task's time tracking data upon completion of the session.

## Productivity Analytics

The **Pomodoro Stats View** provides analytics and historical data about your Pomodoro sessions. This includes a history of completed sessions, as well as metrics like completion rates and total time spent on tasks. The data can be visualized to show productivity patterns over time.
